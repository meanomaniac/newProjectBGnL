maintained peak algo:
The following is assuming the peak has been reached. Will need to consider if it hasn't been reached separately.
1) once you see a change of more than a certain percent (like 40%: var 1) in a duration (lets call this first duration),
  get the note the price at both points (lowPrice, highPrice). Then wait for one hour
1.1) After an hour, get the average price of this coin in the last one hour.
  If this average is more than a certain percent (like 50%) of the coin price 1 hour ago (i.e. at the end of the last interval),
  then proceed to next. Also at this point trigger a road block. The road block logic is for the program to ignore looking for
    changes/peaks in the above first interval more than once which may be triggered because the price change in the next interval
    may also be significant. So if the start point of a duration (like the one that is double that of the first duration) will lie
    within the first duration ignore it.
2) get max recordTime with price less than (the lowPrice + a certain percent(like 10% of var 1 = 4 %)).
  Ensure using where clause that this recordTime is greater than the record Time
  of the beginning of this first time duration but less that the end of the first time Duration.
  a) If this point (pt X) is not the same as the beginning point of the first duration then pt X is the base of the peak
  and we shall call it Pt. A
  b) If this point is the same as the beginning of this first duration then its possible that you haven't reached the base.
  In this case, get the difference of the price between this lowPrice point and 15 mins ago - say Pt. Y (you can do this by
  using a sql similar to the one that you use to get the gainers and losers. You can get the min and max times
  in this time range for this coin and then use join to get the prices at these points). If Pt. Y is greater than
  say 95% of the lowPice then lowPrice is indeed the base, if not continue this until you get a Pt. Y that matches this criteria.
  When you do, the higher end time of that 15 min interval is the base point of the peak - Pt. A
3) get the min recordTime with price = highPrice. Ensure using where clause that this recordTime
  is greater than the record Time of the beginning of this time duration but less that the end of the time Duration.
  Repeat the procedure similar to step 2) to get the peak point ( This is highPoint (Pt. B)). Don't go any higher than say
  15 min intervals as you may get incorrect data because of the onset of another peak.
4) Get difference of recordTimes between Pt A and Pt B. This is timeToPeak.
5) use 15 min time intervals like in steps 2 and 3 to get the max record time which has a price point that is either less
than say 110% of the Pt B and greater than say 60% of pt. B. This is Pt. C.
6) Get difference of recordTimes between Pt B and Pt C. This is the peak maintain time.
